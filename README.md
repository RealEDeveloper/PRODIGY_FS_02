The employee management application is a comprehensive tool designed to manage employee records efficiently.

It allows users to perform CRUD operations—Create, Read, Update, and Delete—on employee details such as names, roles, contact information, and other relevant data.

The application offers a user-friendly interface for easy navigation through employee records and provides search and filter functionalities for quick access to specific data.

Authentication and validation mechanisms ensure secure access, where only authorized personnel can modify or view sensitive information. 

Proper input validation is enforced to prevent incorrect data entry, and the system integrates role-based access control to differentiate between admin and regular user privileges. 
This ensures the safety and accuracy of the employee data while streamlining the management process.
